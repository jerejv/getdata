The study design for the experiment itself (and not the tidying of the data) can be found in UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt

This data was then stripped down to its means and standard deviations for each activity_name / subject_id combination and the mean was taken for
each remaining measurement by activity_name / subject_id.
